    "lvc-description": "What services provide little or no benefit to patients or even can cause harm, cause unnecessary cost to patients, or waste limited healthcare resources ?",
    "lab-test-title": "Daily blood tests without need.",
    "lab-test-description": "Many hospitalized patients receive daily blood tests, even when results are stable. In teaching hospitals, frequent testing may stem from caution and clinical training. However, overuse can cause discomfort, anemia, and stress. The LUCID project explores when blood tests are truly necessary—helping hospitals reduce low-value care and improve decision-making.",
    "sedatives-title": "Sedative prescriptions for older patients.",
    "sedatives-description": "The prescription of benzodiazepines (BZD) and other sedatives in adults aged over 65 years is considered low-value care, due to its association with various complications, such as prolonged hospital stays and falls.",
    "transfusions-title": "Unnecessary blood transfusions.",
    "transfusions-description": "Administering red blood cell transfusions to patients who aren’t bleeding and don’t have very low haemoglobin levels is considered low-value care. They don’t help people recover and can cause serious reactions or put too much strain on the heart.",
    "sleep-title": "Interrupted sleep in the hospital",
    "sleep-description": "Many patients are routinely woken at night for non-urgent care, such as blood tests or medication, disrupting sleep and potentially delaying recovery. The LUCID project investigates this practice to promote better rest and support healing in hospitalized patients."

    "unknown-title": "Little or no benefit to patients",
    "unknown-description": "We still don’t know how often low-value care happens in Swiss hospitals or what harm it causes. These practices provide little or no benefit to hospitalized patients and can even expose them to unnecessary risks. The LUCID research project studies this impact to help ensure care truly improves health.",
    "harm-title": "Potential for harm",
    "harm-description": "Low-value care can harm patients with side effects, stress or complications. The LUCID project examines these risks in Swiss hospitals to make care safer, more effective, and truly patient‑focused.",
    "healthcare-cost-title": "Wasted healthcare resources",
    "healthcare-cost-description": "Low-value care consumes valuable hospital resources—staff time, beds, and money—that could be better used for patients who truly need them. The LUCID research project examines this impact to promote more efficient care and smarter use of healthcare resources in Swiss hospitals."

    "datastream-title": "National Data Stream on Quality of Care in Swiss University Hospitals ",
    "layer1-title": "What data does LUCID use?",
    "layer1-description": "<b>LUCID uses data from patients who have consented during a hospital stay</b> at one of Switzerland’s five university hospitals—Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Bern, or Basel—for the reuse of routinely collected data. Personal details are removed and replaced with secure codes to protect privacy. <b>Patients may withdraw consent at any time to stop future use of their data.</b>",
    "layer2-title": "What types of data are collected?",
    "layer2-description": "The project collects information about <b>hospital care, including diagnoses, treatments, test results, and how patients were cared for during their stay and at discharge.</b>",
    "layer3-title": "How does LUCID get the data?",
    "layer3-description": "Data that is regularly recorded in medical records <b>is collected, stripped of personal information, and prepared following strict Swiss privacy and IT guidelines.</b> It is then safely sent to a secure national research platform for analysis.",
    "layer4-title": "What happens to the data?",
    "layer4-description": "Researchers can request access to LUCID data, but <b>only approved researchers are allowed to use de-identified information to study low-value care </b>and identify ways to improve patient care, while ensuring hospital identities remain confidential.",
    "layer5-title": "How  LUCID may  improve care",
    "layer5-description": "By analyzing patient journeys during hospital stays, <b>LUCID helps hospitals understand, follow and improve their low-value care practices.</b>",
    "layer6-title": "How can researchers access LUCID data?",
    "layer6-description": "Researchers may request access to LUCID data for studies. <b>Every request undergoes a thorough review</b> by a committee of experts appointed by the hospitals and LUCID leaders to ensure it adheres to <b>ethical and legal requirements.</b>",

    "goal1-title": "Create a National Data Stream on the Quality of Hospital Care",
    "goal1-description": "The main goal of the LUCID project is to make it easier to share and access routine clinical data from adult patients in Switzerland’s five main university hospitals. This shared information helps monitor and study the quality of care in hospitals.",
    "goal2-title": "National Insights, Local Impact",
    "goal2-description": "The LUCID project gives a nationwide view of hospital care quality using existing clinical data. It helps researchers and clinicians identify areas that need attention and create targeted actions to improve inpatient care.",
    "goal3-title": "Understand Patient Experiences",
    "goal3-description": "Collecting patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and experience measures (PREMs) is a key priority in LUCID. These tools give patients a voice and show how care impacts their health and daily life. By leading this effort, LUCID helps make care more responsive to what matters most to patients.",
    "goal4-title": "Involve Patients and the Public",
    "goal4-description": "The project will share its findings with every stakeholder: patients, the public, healthcare professionals, and authorities. With this insight, everyone can help build a more patient-centered healthcare system that delivers greater care."
