    "lab-test-title": "Daily blood tests without need.",
    "lab-test-description": "Many hospital patients get blood tests every day, even when results are stable. This overuse is common and can lead to anemia, discomfort, stress, and more unnecessary testing. The LUCID project looks into when, why, and how these tests are ordered, helping hospitals learn when they truly help and when they don’t.",
    "sedatives-title": "Sedative prescriptions for older patients.",
    "sedatives-description": "The prescription of benzodiazepines (BZD) and other sedatives in adults aged over 65 years is considered low-value care, due to its association with various complications, such as prolonged hospital stays and falls.",
    "transfusions-title": "Unnecessary blood transfusions.",
    "transfusions-description": "Giving red blood cell transfusions to patients who aren’t bleeding and don’t have very low haemoglobin levels is considered low-value care. They don’t help people recover and can cause serious reactions or put too much strain on the heart.",
    "sleep-title": "Interrupted sleep in the hospital",
    "sleep-description": "Many patients are woken at night for routine care like blood tests or medication, even when it’s not urgent. This can disrupt sleep and slow recovery. LUCID studies this phenomenon to improve rest and healing."

    "unknown-title": "Little or no benefit to patients",
    "unknown-description": "We still don’t know how often low-value care happens in Swiss hospitals or what harm it causes. These practices provide little or no benefit to hospitalized patients and can even expose them to unnecessary risks. The LUCID research project studies this impact to help ensure care truly improves health.",
    "harm-title": "Potential for harm",
    "harm-description": "Some low-value care can harm patients instead of helping. Unnecessary tests, sedatives, or transfusions may cause side effects, stress, or serious complications. The LUCID research project studies these risks in Swiss hospitalized patients to help make care safer, more effective, and truly focused on patients’ needs.",
    "healthcare-cost-title": "Wasted healthcare resources",
    "healthcare-cost-description": "Low-value care wastes resources that could help patients who truly need them. In Switzerland, it costs an estimated 16 Billion swiss francs - up to 20% of healthcare spending each year. The LUCID research project studies this impact to support smarter use of hospital resources and improve care for hospitalized patients."

    "layer1-title": "What data does LUCID use?",
    "layer1-description": "LUCID uses data from patients who have given general consent during a hospital stay at one of Switzerland’s five university hospitals: Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Bern, or Basel. Personal details are removed and replaced with secure codes to protect privacy. Patients can withdraw their consent at any time to stop future use of their data.",
    "layer2-title": "What types of data are collected?",
    "layer2-description": "The project collects information about hospital care, including diagnoses, treatments, test results, and how patients were cared for during their stay and at discharge.",
    "layer3-title": "How does LUCID get the data?",
    "layer3-description": "Data is regularly taken from electronic medical records, de-identified, and prepared using Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) standards. It is then securely transferred to a protected national research platform.",
    "layer4-title": "What happens to the data?",
    "layer4-description": "Approved researchers can access and use de-identified data to study low-value care, compare treatments across hospitals, and find ways to improve care for patients.",
    "layer5-title": "How does LUCID help improve care?",
    "layer5-description": "By analyzing patient journeys during hospital stays, LUCID helps hospitals understand, follow and improve their low-value care practices.",
    "layer6-title": "How can researchers access LUCID data?",
    "layer6-description": "Researchers can request access to LUCID data for approved studies. Each request is reviewed carefully to ensure it meets ethical and legal standards.",

    "goal1-description": "The main goal of the LUCID National Data Stream (NDS) is to make it easier to share and access routine clinical data from adult patients in Switzerland’s five main university hospitals. This shared information helps monitor and study the quality of care in hospitals.",
    "goal2-title": "National Insights, Local Impact",
    "goal2-description": "The LUCID NDS gives a nationwide view of hospital care quality using existing clinical data. It helps researchers and clinicians identify areas that need attention and create targeted actions to improve inpatient care.",
    "goal3-title": "Understand Patient Experiences",
    "goal3-description": "Collecting patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and experience measures (PREMs) is a key priority in LUCID. These tools give patients a voice and show how care impacts their health and daily life. By leading this effort, LUCID helps make care more responsive to what matters most to patients.",
    "goal4-title": "Involve Patients and the Public",
    "goal4-description": "The project will share its findings with every stakeholder: patients, the public, healthcare professionals, and authorities. With this insight, everyone can help build a more patient-centered healthcare system that delivers higher-value care."
