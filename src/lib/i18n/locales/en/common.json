    "unknown-description": "We still don’t know how often low-value care happens in Swiss hospitals or what harm it causes. These practices provide little or no benefit to hospitalized patients and can even expose them to unnecessary risks. The LUCID research project studies this impact to help ensure care truly improves health.",
    "billion-title": "Potential for harm",
    "billion-description": "Some low-value care can harm patients instead of helping. Unnecessary tests, sedatives, or transfusions may cause side effects, stress, or serious complications. The LUCID research project studies these risks in Swiss hospitalized patients to help make care safer, more effective, and truly focused on patients’ needs.",

    "healthcare-cost-description": "Low-value care wastes resources that could help patients who truly need them. In Switzerland, it costs an estimated 16 Billion swiss francs - up to 20% of healthcare spending each year. The LUCID research project studies this impact to support smarter use of hospital resources and improve care for hospitalized patients."
